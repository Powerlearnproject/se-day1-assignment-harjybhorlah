# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g fortran c)
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting users needs and systems requirements 
Design: creating high-level and detailed design of the software achietecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing codes and building software according to design specifications 
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets quaility standards and functional requirements 
Deployment:Releasing the software to users 
Maintenance: providing ongoing supports, updates and ehancements to the software after deployments  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to project management and software development. It follows a set sequence of phases, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. This approach emphasizes thorough planning and documentation. an exmple of scenarios can be Developing a system for managing internal compliance in a highly regulated industry such as a  financial institution where requirements are clear and unlikely to change during the development process.
while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle. an exmple of scenarios can be  Developing a new consumer app where user feedback is crucial for refining features and usability.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
